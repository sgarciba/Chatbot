# Chatbot

This Chatbot has been created from scratch to conduct simple tasks for hotels. It responds to simple front desk requests such as: greetings, provide with the hotel's location, payment methods and reference different departments. Also, it can create a booking for the customer and cancel it. 

Notice that it has been trained with a small data and its responds are limited, but it still can perform all the tasks that it has been assigned. This chatbot has been built and run using Google Colab, as it needs a GPU to accelerate the training process.
